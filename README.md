# React Project Web: ResponsiveCars

## About

Greetings, I have created this web project with React and using css styles for a class project. The main purpose was to use the module function of React for creating a web using our knowledge in HTML, CSS an JavaScript. 

First of all, I looked for a reference, which is:https://www.figma.com/community/file/1138316365849534403/car-rent-website-design-pickolab-studio

Afterwards, I created a colour palette based on the color I liked for the web and its content:

And finally, I creted the logo of my web with a web AI tool which helped me a lot:https://www.logoai.com/logo/3470164
